# ReactJS Intern Project

## What’s in this Repo?
I’ve taken the original project and added my own touch to it. You’ll find a new folder called ReactInternAssement where I’ve been working on a cool ReactJS + Vite project.

## Development Process

During the development process, I encountered several challenges, particularly with the animation aspects of the project. Animations in ReactJS can be quite intricate, especially when aiming for smooth transitions and responsive interactions.

To overcome these hurdles, I sought assistance from various online resources. This included reading documentation, browsing through community forums, and studying examples on platforms like Stack Overflow and CodePen. These resources proved invaluable, providing insights and techniques that I could adapt and integrate into my project.

## The Tough Parts
<ul>
  <li><b>Looking Good Everywhere</b>: It was a bit of a puzzle to get the animations to look the same on different web browsers.</li>
  <li><b>CSS Animations</b>: I deepened my understanding of keyframes and transition properties to enhance the user interface.</li>
</ul>

 

## Conclusion

This project has been a significant learning experience. I am grateful for the opportunity to improve my skills and contribute to this project.

I look forward to continuing my journey in web development and tackling more complex challenges in the future.
